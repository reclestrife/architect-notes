  - fault tolerence
  - consistency

## Background

### Focus areas
- Distributed computing: MapReduce
- Distributed storage: GFS, NoSQL

### Benifits
- Increase capacity by parallelism
- Improve performance by distribute physical server close to client
- Fault tolerance by replication
- Security by isolation

### Costs
- Collaboration complexity
- Must cope with partial failure

## Main Topics

### Implementation
- __GFS__: Google File System
- __VMWare FT__
- __Zookeeper__

### Performance
- Goal is to manage scalability by adding more computers, rather than redesign by __expensive programmers__
- Challengies when problem volume grows:
  - Load im-balance, stragglers, slowest-of-N latency
  - Non-parallizable code: initialization, interaction
  - Bottleneck of shared resources: network
- Problems that are not easy to resolve by scaling:
  - Quick response time for single user request
  - Updating same shared data often requires better design rather than scaling

### Fault Tolerence
- Partial failure is very normal
- Goal is to hide the failures from application
- Often wants: Availability and recoverability
- Solution: replication, if one server dies, other can still work

### Consistency
- General purpose infra needs well-defined behavior, e.g. Get() will always return result of the recent Put()
- Achieving good behavior is hard!
  - "Replica" servers are hard to keep identical.
  - Clients may crash midway through multi-step update.
  - Servers may crash, e.g. after executing but before replying.
  - Network partition may make live servers look dead; risk of "__split brain__".
- __Consistency__ and __performance__ are enemies.
  - Strong consistency requires communication, e.g. Get() must check for a recent Put().
  - Many designs provide only weak consistency, to gain speed, e.g. Get() does _not_ yield the latest Put()! Painful for application programmers but may be a good trade-off.
- Many design points are possible in the consistency/performance spectrum!
