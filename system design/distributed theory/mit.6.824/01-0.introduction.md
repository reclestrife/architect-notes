- Main topics of the course
  - implementation
  - performance
  - fault tolerence
  - consistency

## Background

### Focus areas

- Distributed computing: MapReduce
- Distributed storage: GFS

### Benifits

- Increase capacity by parallelism
- Fault tolerance by replication
- Security by isolation

### Costs

- Collaboration complexity
- Must cope with partial failure

## Main Topics

### Implementations
- __GFS__: Google File System
- __VMWare FT__
- __Zookeeper__

### Performance
- Goal is to manage scalability by adding more computers, rather than redesign by expensive programmers
- Challengies when problem volume grows:
  - Load im-balance, stragglers, slowest-of-N latency
  - Non-parallizable code: initialization, interaction
  - Bottleneck of shared resources: network
- Problems that are not easy to resolve by scaling:
  - Quick response time for single user request
  - Updating same shared data often requires better design rather than scaling
